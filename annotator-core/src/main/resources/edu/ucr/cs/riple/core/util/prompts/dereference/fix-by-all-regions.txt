I want to resolve a warning reported by NullAway.
I am getting the error that in line: %s, the dereferenced expression %s is @Nullable and can produce Null Pointer Exception. In the method below:
%s
%s
Here are all the other places where the dereferenced expression is used:
%s
Given the information above, I want you to fix the error by rewriting the code snippet in the method below. If you can provide a default value (such as Set.of() or any other value depending on the code ) for the dereferenced expression or rewrite the code snippet to avoid the error.
If you can fix the error, please provide the fixed code snippet in XML format. I just need the xml response, no other information is needed. If you can provide the fixed code snippet, please provide it in the following format and place the code snippet in the <code> tag within ```java block.
For examples:
<response>
  <success>true</success>
  <code><![CDATA[
  ```java
  Your fixed code snippet here, JUST THE METHOD.
  ```
    ]]>
  </code>
</response>
Or if you cannot fix the error. please provide the output in XML format as below.
<response>
  <success>false</success>
</response>
If your answer is simply to do a null check and throw an exception, such as below:

```java
if(%s == null) {
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("The %s is null");
}
```
Still response with no success.
<response>
  <success>false</success>
</response>
