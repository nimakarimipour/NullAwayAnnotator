- Updated annotation injections in Injector to simply add the annotation without indentation.
- Removed up index store.
- Added cached evaluators.
- Enhanced data structure to store the set of resolving fixes.
- Removed triggered fixes from iterations as a driver for the analysis.
- Updated unit test templates for test infrastructure to use error prone `2.0.1`
- Added tracker constructions and public APIs.
- Added support for detecting potentially impacted regions generated by Lombok.
- Changed all path types from `String` or `URI` to `Path`.
- Updated injector class search to support annotations within enum constants.
- Fixed the bug preventing annotator to add `@NullUnmarked` on constructs.
- Added support for acknowledging existing `@Nonnull` annotations and prevent annotator from adding `@Nullable` on these elements.
- Updated impacted region detection to include constructors for uninitialized fields. 
- Updated Annotator to support NullAway `0.10.10`
- Bug fixes and refactorings.

### Version 1.3.5
- Removed Lexical Preserving flag for injector.
- Updated injector to add annotations without indentation.

- Added infrastructure to support backward compatibility with previous versions of NullAway.
- Updated SuppressWarnings injections logic.
- Renamed maven group id and annotator core and scanner modules.
- Added release scripts to cut a release in maven central.

- Bug fixes and refactorings.

### VERSION 1.3.3
- Enabled detection of flow of @Nullable back to upstream from downstream.
- Renamed `MethodInheritanceTree` to `MethodDeclarationTree`.
- Added configuration modes for downstream dependency analysis (`strict`|`lower bound` | `upper bound` | `default`).
- Updated fix tree construction with triggered fixes from downstream dependencies.
- Added report cache.
- Added extra cycle for better reduction of errors.
- Support `@NullUnmarked` and `@SuppressWarnings` injection to resolve all remaining errors.

- Added Error Prone checkers to all modules.
- Enhanced analysis of downstream dependencies to execute in parallel.
- Renamed `Scanner` module to `Type Annotator Scanner`.
- Added `Library Models Loader` module to interact with `NullAway` when analyzing downstream dependencies.
- Updated `Core` module installation by forcing Maven Publish to use shadowJar output.
- Banned mutable declaration of static fields in Annotator code base.
- Added `UUID` to every generated config file by annotator to ensure re-run of the analysis.
- Updated testing infrastructure.
- Fixed bug in `Injector` when the target element is in generated code.
- Enhanced error report/handling in `Injector` when target class is not located.
- Removed parameter names and uri for method serializations.
